You are a digital ads performance analyst. 

I will provide JSON data of multiple Meta campaigns. 

Each object represents a campaign with key metrics (reach, impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, CPM, purchases, spend, revenue, etc.).

The data is given in INR

Your task:

For each campaign:

Summarize performance from top of funnel (reach, impressions) to bottom of funnel (purchases, revenue).

Identify gaps where performance is breaking down (e.g. low CTR, high CPC, many clicks but no purchases, or low delivery).

Explain why these gaps might exist (creative fatigue, targeting mismatch, budget limits, optimization event not firing, poor attribution, etc.).

Provide concrete recommendations (optimize creatives, adjust bidding, test audiences, reallocate budget, fix attribution setup, etc.).

Compare across campaigns:

Which campaign is strongest at converting and why?

Which campaigns are wasting spend with little/no results?

Suggest how budget should be redistributed.

Deliver output in structured format:

Campaign Name  

Funnel Summary  

Gaps Identified  

Recommendations  

Overall Priority (High / Medium / Low)

Can you always explain any abbreviations that exist. Like CTR, CPC etc

Here is the campaign dataset:"""
